# About Lingonary 
Lingonary is an Android app that helps learners practice a new language through short podcast-style content, a word library, and quizzes. It supports one tap from confusion to comprehension: While listening podcasts, tap any word in the time-synced transcript to see meaning inline and save it –no context switch. Later, review those words with spaced practice grounded in the original audio.

Our Main Tasks:
1) Listen to a podcast
2) Peek definition and save word
3) Take a quiz

Our Main Features:
1) Tap on a word to see definition
2) Save the vocab to a word library
3) Reinforce learning through informal quizzes
